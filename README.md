# ATM_INTERFACE

We have all come across ATMs in our cities, and they are built on Java. This complex project consists of
five different classes and is a console-based application. When the system starts, the user is
prompted with the user ID and user pin. On entering the details successfully, ATM functionalities
are unlocked. The project allows for the following operations:

1. Transaction History

2. Withdraw

3. Deposit

4. Transfer

5. Quit
